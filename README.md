# Hamster Smasher
##### I wanted to improve my JavaScript skills, so I decided to make simple game. Player has to smash appearing hamsters. You are gaining points or loosing lifes, if you miss the hamster. I know, hitboxes are awful. Every hamster is going through some function (siting, smash event), when appropriate time is come.
